**Customer Shopping Behaviour Analysis**

Data Analyst Portfolio Project

**📌 Project Overview**

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow focused on understanding customer shopping behaviour.
It covers data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and insight generation using Python, SQL, and Power BI, simulating real-world data analyst responsibilities.

The objective is to transform raw retail customer data into actionable business insights that can support decision-making related to customer segmentation, purchasing patterns, and loyalty.

**🧰 Tools & Technologies**

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
SQL (MySQL )
Power BI

**🔍 Key Analysis Steps**

Data cleaning and preprocessing using Python
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Loading cleaned data into a SQL database
Writing SQL queries to answer business questions
Building an interactive Power BI dashboard
Interpreting insights and summarizing findings

**📊 Business Questions Answered**

The following key business questions were answered using SQL:

1. What is the total revenue generated by male vs female customers?  
2. Which customers used discounts but still spent more than the average purchase amount?  
3. Which are the top 5 products with the highest average review ratings?  
4. How does the average purchase amount compare between Standard and Express shipping?  
5. Do subscribed customers spend more than non-subscribers?  
6. Which 5 products have the highest percentage of purchases with discounts applied?  
7. How can customers be segmented into New, Returning, and Loyal based on purchase history?  
8. What are the top 3 most purchased products within each category?  
9. Are repeat buyers (more than 5 previous purchases) more likely to subscribe?  
10. What is the revenue contribution of each age group?

**📈 Dashboard**

The **Customer Behavior Dashboard** provides insights into:

- Total number of customers  
- Average purchase amount  
- Average customer review rating  
- Revenue and sales by product category  
- Subscription vs non-subscription distribution  
- Revenue and sales by age group  
- Filters for gender, category, subscription status, and shipping type  

The dashboard enables interactive exploration of customer behaviour and purchasing trends.

**🔍 Key Insights**

- Clothing generates the highest revenue among all categories  
- Young adults contribute the largest share of total revenue  
- Subscribed customers show higher engagement and spending patterns  
- Discount usage influences purchase behaviour differently across customer segments
